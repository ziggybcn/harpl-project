!This is a small Harpl source code sample.
!This sample creates 2 string variables, and outputs them to the console, 
!using a simple concatenation expression that also adds a "!" character 
!at the end of the output text.

Define FirstWord as string = 'Hello', SecondWord as String = 'world';
Output FirstWord ++ " " ++SecondWord ++ "!";

Define White as Integer = #FFFFFF;
Output "White color has a value of " ++ White
Define another as Integer = 255
Output "White with some operations=" ++ another ^2 ++ " but it could be a lot worse."
