# Introduction #

We'll describe here how the compilation process is performed on the Harpl compilation strategy


# Details #

  1. **Lexing**: Performed by the Lexer class. In this step, a given  string containing Harpl source code is splitted into tokens. Tokens are the significative "words" that the compiler is able to understand. In this step several compilation errors may be found (syntax errors).<br />
  1. **Compilation**: This is performed by the Harpl Compiler. The Harpl compiler converts a list of tokens (produced by the lexer) to an assembler object. An assembler object is the kind of object that the Harpl assembler (HBCC) is able to understand.<br />
  1. **Assembling**: The Harpl Byte Code Assembler (HBCC) transforms an assembler object into a Byte Code object. A ByteCode object is the kind of object that can be directly executed by the Harpl Virtual Machine. You can think of Byte Code object as if they were EXE files on windows, or JAR files in the Java world. they're the Harpl executable objects. <br />
  1. **Execution**:The Harpel VM executes the generated Byte Code Object.
